This is for resizing a group of images that do not need to be so large.
It will convert all selected files to a width, a height, or a percent.
It automatically will sharpen and correct the images.
If the Rename Checkbox is checked, it will save the smaller file with a sequence number appended to the name, else it will save the file by the same name.
This doesn't do any cropping or most other fixes, so don't run it on an image you plan to edit.
This does automatically do minor Sharpen, Contrast, and AutoLevel... cuz it looks good that way.
It took about 3 seconds per image.
The reduction in size I saw was about 6 to 1. Obviously, that will vary.
